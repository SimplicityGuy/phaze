## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase pipeline from infrastructure through safe file execution
- Roadmap: Phases 2 and 4 can run in parallel (both depend only on Phase 1)
- [Phase 01]: Used check-github-workflows/check-github-actions hook IDs (renamed from validate-* in check-jsonschema 0.31.3)
- [Phase 01]: Updated pre-commit hooks to latest versions with frozen 40-char SHA revisions

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Naming format template is TBD -- must be decided before Phase 6 (AI Proposal Generation) can be fully planned
- arq maintenance-only status -- monitor before Phase 4; taskiq is fallback
- litellm supply chain risk -- pin exact version with hash verification
