# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** Get 200K messy music and concert files properly named, organized, deduplicated, with rich metadata in Postgres -- human-in-the-loop approval so nothing moves without review.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — task-queue-worker-infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 5

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8-phase pipeline from infrastructure through safe file execution
- Roadmap: Phases 2 and 4 can run in parallel (both depend only on Phase 1)
- [Phase 01]: Used check-github-workflows/check-github-actions hook IDs (renamed from validate-* in check-jsonschema 0.31.3)
- [Phase 01]: Updated pre-commit hooks to latest versions with frozen 40-char SHA revisions
- [Phase 01]: Used pre-commit/action@v3.0.1 for CI code quality instead of manual pre-commit run
- [Phase 04]: Used ClassVar annotation on WorkerSettings.functions for ruff RUF012 compliance
- [Phase 04]: arq Retry stores defer as defer_score in milliseconds
- [Phase 04]: ASGITransport test client does not invoke lifespan — no Redis mock needed in conftest

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Naming format template is TBD -- must be decided before Phase 6 (AI Proposal Generation) can be fully planned
- arq maintenance-only status -- monitor before Phase 4; taskiq is fallback
- litellm supply chain risk -- pin exact version with hash verification
