# Phase 58: Enrich + Analyze workspaces — Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** The shell's first real content — Discover, Metadata, Fingerprint, and Analyze stage workspaces over their **existing** endpoints, with the Analyze workspace presenting the three execution lanes (local / A1 / k8s) as first-class live-capacity cards. All live updates ride the one `/pipeline/stats` 5s poll established in Phase 57.
**Verified:** 2026-06-30T21:42:00Z
**Status:** human_needed
**Re-verification:** Yes — after W-1 gap closure (commit 24f70be)

## Re-verification Summary

The prior verification scored 5/5 truths with status `human_needed` for two reasons:
1. **WARNING W-1** — the derived store keys `notYetEnriched` / `computeOnline` were seeded only in the legacy `base.html` store, NOT the standalone v7.0 shell's own inline `Alpine.store('pipeline', {...})`, causing an `undefined` initial-paint flash until the first poll.
2. A live single-poll browser UAT (browser-only, deployment-gated).

**W-1 is now RESOLVED (commit 24f70be).** Confirmed against source + test:
- `src/phaze/templates/shell/shell.html:139` adds `notYetEnriched: 0, computeOnline: 0` **inside** the shell's own `Alpine.store('pipeline', {...})` object (opens line 105, closes line 140) — directly addressing the base.html/shell.html store divergence. Comment (lines 135-138) documents the Phase-58 intent.
- Regression test `tests/test_enrich_analyze_workspaces.py:181 test_shell_store_seeds_phase58_keys` fetches `GET /` and asserts both `"notYetEnriched: 0"` and `"computeOnline: 0"` are present in the rendered shell body. The test is real (not a stub) and **passes**.
- Phase-58 suite now **13 passed** (was 12 — the +1 is the new regression test): `TEST_DATABASE_URL=…@localhost:5433/phaze_test PHAZE_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6380/0 uv run pytest tests/test_enrich_analyze_workspaces.py tests/test_shell_routes.py -q` → `13 passed`.

W-1 is therefore **removed** from this report. No regressions detected: all five truths remain VERIFIED.

The **only** remaining item is the live single-poll browser UAT — genuinely browser-only (no Alpine runtime executes in httpx render tests) and deployment-gated. It is treated as a **deferred-to-live human UAT item** (same class as Phase 57.1's deferred-to-live items), not a code gap.

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth (WORK req) | Status | Evidence |
|---|------------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | WORK-01 — Discover shows recent scans + discovered/not-yet-enriched count + scan trigger | ✓ VERIFIED | `discover_workspace.html` composes the scaffold, renders `recent_scans` via `_file_table.html` (self-poll stripped), live sub-count binds `$store.pipeline.discovered`/`.notYetEnriched` (now seeded to int 0 in shell store — W-1 fixed), SCAN→`/pipeline/scans`, RECOVER→`/pipeline/recover` (R-4 confirm + `:disabled`). `shell.py:113` loads `recent_scans`. `pipeline.py:235` derives `notYetEnriched`. Tests `test_discover_workspace` + `test_shell_store_seeds_phase58_keys` pass. |
| 2 | WORK-02 — Metadata/Fingerprint show queue + existing manual trigger | ✓ VERIFIED | `metadata_workspace.html` EXTRACT ALL `hx-post="/pipeline/extract-metadata"`; `fingerprint_workspace.html` FINGERPRINT ALL `hx-post="/pipeline/fingerprint"` — both verbatim existing endpoints (D-01), R-4 guard, NO `EXTRACT SELECTED`/checkbox (D-02). `shell.py:123,129` load the pending queues. Test `test_metadata_trigger_all_wired` passes. |
| 3 | WORK-03 — Analyze shows 3 live lane cards (local/A1/k8s) + Kueue quota-wait vs Inadmissible | ✓ VERIFIED | `analyze_workspace.html` always renders all 3 `_lane_card.html` in `#analyze-lanes`; down/unconfigured lanes greyed + labelled `offline`/`not configured` w/ 0 cap (D-05). A1 capacity binds `$store.pipeline.computeOnline` (now seeded to int 0 — W-1 fixed). `inadmissible_card.html`+`localqueue_card.html` carry `role="alert"`; `admission_state_card.html` does NOT. Test `test_lane_cards_states` passes. |
| 4 | WORK-04 — each in-flight file shows lane + windowed progress | ✓ VERIFIED | `get_analyze_stage_files` (services/pipeline.py:768) derives lane (no cloud_job→local / cloud_phase NULL→a1 / set→k8s) + reads `fine_windows_analyzed/total`. `analyze_workspace.html` renders completed `window a/total`, in-flight `running · N/M windows` (D-04, NOT bare running). Inert rows (D-06). Test `test_analyze_file_table_lane_and_windows` passes with explicit B2 mid-flight guard. |
| 5 | WORK-05 — workspaces refresh live via single /pipeline/stats poll + visibilitychange shed | ✓ VERIFIED | `shell.html` exactly one `#pipeline-stats` poll outside `#stage-workspace` w/ `[document.visibilityState === 'visible']` filter + visibilitychange listener. No workspace fragment carries `hx-trigger="every"`/`setInterval`. Test `test_single_poll_discipline` asserts exactly one poll. Live in-browser refresh/shed behaviour deferred to live UAT (below). |

**Score:** 5/5 truths verified — no WARNINGs remaining (W-1 resolved).

| Shell store seeds Phase-58 keys | `test_shell_store_seeds_phase58_keys` | passed | ✓ PASS |

### Probe Execution

No phase-declared probes; this is a presentation phase verified via pytest (above). Step 7c N/A.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| WORK-01 | 58-02 | Discover recent scans + not-yet-enriched + scan trigger | ✓ SATISFIED | Truth 1 |
| WORK-02 | 58-03 | Metadata/Fingerprint queue + existing manual trigger | ✓ SATISFIED | Truth 2 |
| WORK-03 | 58-04 | 3 lane cards + Kueue quota-wait vs Inadmissible | ✓ SATISFIED | Truth 3 |
| WORK-04 | 58-04 | per-file lane + windowed progress | ✓ SATISFIED | Truth 4 |
| WORK-05 | 58-01/02/03/04 | live refresh via single stats-poll | ✓ SATISFIED | Truth 5 |

All 5 phase requirement IDs accounted for; no orphans (REQUIREMENTS.md maps only WORK-01..05 to Phase 58; WORK-06 is explicitly deferred and not claimed by any plan).

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| (none) | — | No TBD/FIXME/XXX/TODO/HACK debt markers in any modified file | ℹ️ Info | Debt-marker gate clean |
| metadata/fingerprint workspaces | pending cells | `—` placeholder for not-yet-enriched values | ℹ️ Info | Documented intentional (Phase 61 owns populated record; pending files are semantically empty) |
| analyze_workspace.html | 35-36 | `ROUTE RULES` / `PAUSE` buttons inert (no handler) | ℹ️ Info | Documented intentional per UI-SPEC/SUMMARY; live pause/priority remain on DAG canvas, not required by WORK-03/04/05 |

### Human Verification Required

1. **Live single-poll refresh + shed (WORK-05 UAT)** — Open `/s/analyze` with files in flight; watch the network tab ~15s.
   - Expected: exactly one `/pipeline/stats` request per 5s; lane numerals + per-file N/M windows refresh in place; polling pauses when the tab is backgrounded, resumes on foreground.
   - Why human: in-browser timing + visibilitychange cannot be observed by the structural tests (no Alpine runtime in httpx). **Deferred-to-live, deployment-gated — not a code gap** (same class as Phase 57.1's deferred-to-live items).

### Gaps Summary

No blocking gaps. **W-1 from the prior verification is RESOLVED** (commit 24f70be): the two derived store keys `notYetEnriched` and `computeOnline` are now seeded to int `0` inside the v7.0 shell's own `Alpine.store('pipeline', {...})` (shell.html:139), eliminating the initial-paint `undefined` flash; a real regression test (`test_shell_store_seeds_phase58_keys`) asserts both keys in the rendered `GET /` and passes. The full Phase-58 surface is green (13 passed, up from 12).

All five WORK requirements are functionally delivered and verified in the codebase: the four workspaces render as bare fragments into `#stage-workspace`, wired verbatim to existing endpoints; the Analyze workspace always renders three lane cards with the offline/not-configured states and the Kueue quota-wait-vs-Inadmissible `role=alert` distinction; the per-file table derives lane and renders the 57.1 mid-flight N/M windowed signal; and the whole shell refreshes through exactly one `/pipeline/stats` poll with a visibilitychange shed. Decisions D-01..D-06 are all honored.

Status is `human_needed` solely for the one remaining live single-poll browser UAT — browser-only and deployment-gated, treated as deferred-to-live (not a code gap). All code-level verification is complete with no warnings.
