# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**phaze** — A music alignment tool. Python 3.13, MIT licensed.

## Development Setup

- **Python**: 3.13 exclusively
- **Package manager**: `uv` only — never use bare `pip`, `python`, `pytest`, or `mypy`. Always prefix with `uv run`.
- **Pre-commit**: Must be installed and active. All hooks must pass before commits.

### Key Commands

```bash
uv sync                    # Install dependencies
uv run pytest              # Run tests
uv run pytest tests/test_foo.py::test_bar  # Run a single test
uv run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing  # Run tests with coverage
uv run ruff check .        # Lint
uv run ruff format .       # Format
uv run mypy .              # Type check
pre-commit run --all-files # Run all pre-commit hooks
```

## Code Quality

### Ruff Configuration

Line length: 150. Target: Python 3.13.

**Enabled rule sets**: `ARG`, `B`, `C4`, `E`, `F`, `I`, `PLC`, `PTH`, `RUF`, `S`, `SIM`, `T20`, `TCH`, `UP`, `W`, `W191`

**Ignored rules**: `B008`, `C901`, `E501`, `S101`

**Per-file ignores**: Allow `T201` (print) in CLI/entry points and tests. Tests also ignore `PLC` and `S105`.

**isort**: `lines-after-imports = 2`, `combine-as-imports = true`, `split-on-trailing-comma = true`, `force-sort-within-sections = true`. Set `known-first-party` to project package name.

**Format**: `quote-style = "double"`, `indent-style = "space"`, `docstring-code-format = false`.

### Mypy Configuration

```toml
[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.13"
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
disallow_untyped_defs = true
disallow_incomplete_defs = true
check_untyped_defs = true
disallow_untyped_decorators = true
no_implicit_optional = true
warn_redundant_casts = true
warn_unused_ignores = true
warn_no_return = true
warn_unreachable = true
strict_equality = true
explicit_package_bases = true
exclude = "^tests/"
```

Override for tests: `disallow_untyped_decorators = false`.

### Pre-commit Hooks

Use frozen SHAs (not just tags) for all hooks. Required hooks:

- **pre-commit-hooks**: large files, merge conflicts, TOML, YAML, JSON, EOF fixer, trailing whitespace, mixed line endings
- **ruff-pre-commit**: `ruff --fix` + `ruff-format`
- **bandit**: `-x tests -s B608`
- **check-jsonschema**: GitHub workflows/actions validation
- **actionlint**: GitHub Actions linting
- **yamllint**: strict mode
- **shellcheck-py**: `--shell=bash --severity=warning`
- **Local mypy hook**: `uv run mypy .` with `pass_filenames: false`

## Testing

- Minimum **85% code coverage** required
- Upload coverage to Codecov with service-specific flags
- Codecov config: precision 2, round down, range 70-100%, project target auto with 1% threshold, patch target 80% with 5% threshold

## Workflow: Features and PRs

- **Every feature gets its own git worktree** — no cross-contamination between features
- **Every feature gets its own PR** — one PR per feature, no mixing unrelated changes
- Never push directly to main

## CI (GitHub Actions)

Follow the discogsography pattern:

- **Reusable workflows** via `workflow_call` — separate jobs for code quality, tests, security
- **Code quality job**: runs all pre-commit hooks
- **Test job**: runs pytest with coverage, uploads to Codecov with flags and `disable_search: true`
- **Security job**: pip-audit, bandit, Semgrep, TruffleHog secret scanning
- **Concurrency groups** with `cancel-in-progress` on PR workflows
- Emoji prefixes on all step names

## Code Style

- 150-character line length
- Type hints on all functions
- Double quotes for strings
- PEP 8 conventions
- `pyproject.toml` section order: `[build-system]` → `[project]` → `[project.scripts]` → `[tool.*]` → `[dependency-groups]`, with alphabetically sorted dependencies

## Project

**Phaze**

A music collection organizer that ingests music files (mp3, m4a, ogg) and concert video streams, fingerprints and analyzes them, uses AI to propose better filenames and destination paths, and provides an admin web UI to review and approve the renames/moves. Designed for a single user managing a large personal archive of music and live concert recordings (primarily full sets from events like Coachella).

**Core Value:** Get messy music and concert files properly named, organized into logical folders, deduplicated, with rich metadata in Postgres — and provide a human-in-the-loop approval workflow so nothing moves without review.

### Constraints

- **Language**: Python 3.13 exclusively
- **Package manager**: uv only
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose on home server, private network
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Scale**: Must handle large file counts efficiently — batch processing and parallelization required
- **Existing code**: Must integrate with provided analysis prototypes and respect their per-file interface
- **Naming format**: AI filename proposals — specific format TBD (will be provided later)

| FFmpeg (system) | 8.x | Audio/video processing | Required for audio decoding and video stream metadata extraction via ffprobe. Install in Docker image. |
### Web UI
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Jinja2 | >=3.1 | Server-side templating | Ships with FastAPI. Server-rendered HTML means no separate frontend build, no SPA complexity. Perfect for admin-only tool. |
| HTMX | 2.x (CDN) | Dynamic UI interactions | Eliminates need for React/Vue/Angular. Adds SPA-like interactivity (approve/reject buttons, live search, pagination) via HTML attributes. Zero build step. 90% of SPA functionality, 10% of complexity. |
| Tailwind CSS | 3.x (CDN) | Styling | Utility-first CSS. Use via CDN (no build step) for a single-user admin tool. DaisyUI component library optional for pre-built components. |
| Alpine.js | 3.x (CDN) | Lightweight JS interactions | 3KB library for dropdown menus, modals, toggling states. Complements HTMX for client-side state that HTMX doesn't handle. |
### Task Processing
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| SAQ | >=0.26.3 | Async task queue | Purpose-built for asyncio + Redis. Inspired by arq with active maintenance. Perfect for file analysis jobs (BPM, fingerprinting, metadata extraction). Supports retries with backoff, job results, cron jobs, built-in web UI. Single-user app doesn't need Celery's complexity. |
### AI / LLM Integration
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| litellm | >=1.82.6 (pin exact) | Unified LLM API client | Single interface to 100+ LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models). Avoids vendor lock-in. Use for filename/path proposals. **IMPORTANT:** Pin exact version due to March 2026 supply chain incident on versions 1.82.7-1.82.8. Verify checksums. |
| pydantic | >=2.10 | Data validation / LLM structured output | Already a FastAPI dependency. Use for validating LLM responses (proposed filenames, paths). Structured output parsing. |
### Configuration / Infrastructure
| Technology | Version | Purpose | Why Recommended |
|------------|---------|---------|-----------------|
| pydantic-settings | >=2.13.1 | Configuration management | Type-safe config from env vars, .env files, Docker secrets. Native Pydantic integration. Supports `SecretStr` for API keys. |
| uvicorn | >=0.34.0 | ASGI server | Standard production server for FastAPI. Use with `--workers` for multi-process or behind gunicorn for production. |
### Development Tools
| Tool | Purpose | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| uv | Package management | Project constraint. Fast, deterministic. Use `uv run` prefix for all commands. |
| ruff | Linting + formatting | Already configured in CLAUDE.md. Replaces flake8, black, isort. |
| mypy | Type checking | Already configured. Strict mode excluding tests. |
| pytest | Testing | With pytest-asyncio for async tests, pytest-cov for coverage. |
| pytest-asyncio | Async test support | Required for testing async endpoints, database operations, task queue jobs. |
| httpx | HTTP test client | FastAPI's recommended test client. Use `AsyncClient` for async endpoint testing. |
| pre-commit | Git hooks | Already configured in CLAUDE.md. |
## Installation
# Core application
# Audio processing
# AI integration
# Dev dependencies
# System dependencies (Dockerfile)
# apt-get install -y ffmpeg chromaprint-tools
## Alternatives Considered
| Recommended | Alternative | When to Use Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| FastAPI | Litestar | If you want more explicit DI and slightly lower memory usage. FastAPI wins on ecosystem size, docs quality, and community support. |
| SQLAlchemy | SQLModel | If models are simple and you want less boilerplate. SQLModel is a thin FastAPI-aligned wrapper over SQLAlchemy but has fewer features and weaker async story. Stick with SQLAlchemy for large-scale systems. |
| SAQ | Celery | If you need multi-broker support, complex routing, or canvas workflows. Overkill for a single-user app. Celery's config complexity is not justified here. |
| SAQ | Dramatiq | If you want RabbitMQ support or more mature retry/middleware. Dramatiq is sync-first which conflicts with our async stack. |
| HTMX + Jinja2 | React/Vue SPA | If you need offline capability, complex client-side state, or multiple developers on frontend. A single-user admin tool does not need SPA complexity or a separate build pipeline. |
| litellm | Direct OpenAI SDK | If you are committed to a single LLM provider forever. litellm provides flexibility to switch between local/cloud models with zero code changes. |
| mutagen | tinytag | If you only need read-only metadata. We need write capability to update tags after renaming, so mutagen is required. |
| essentia-tensorflow | librosa | If you only need basic BPM/tempo and don't need pre-trained classification models. Essentia provides richer analysis (mood, style, danceability) via TensorFlow models. |
## What NOT to Use
| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| ffmpeg-python (pip: `ffmpeg-python`) | Last PyPI release was 2022. Effectively abandoned. 500+ open issues on GitHub. | Use `subprocess.run(["ffprobe", ...])` directly for metadata extraction. Or `python-ffmpeg` (pip: `python-ffmpeg`) which is actively maintained. |
| SQLite | Cannot handle concurrent writes from multiple worker processes analyzing files in parallel. No JSON operators for flexible metadata queries. | PostgreSQL (project constraint). |
| Celery | Massive dependency tree, complex configuration, sync-first design. Overkill for single-user app with Redis already in stack. | SAQ for async task queue. |
| Django | Full MVC framework with ORM, admin, auth -- all unnecessary when you have FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + custom admin UI. Sync-first design conflicts with async processing needs. | FastAPI. |
| LangChain | Enormous abstraction layer for LLM calls. This project just needs "send prompt, get structured response." LangChain adds complexity without benefit for simple classification/naming tasks. | litellm for provider abstraction + raw Pydantic for structured output. |
| React/Next.js | Requires separate build pipeline, Node.js in Docker, npm dependencies. Completely unnecessary for a single-user admin approval UI. | HTMX + Jinja2 + Tailwind CSS via CDN. |
| tinytag | Read-only metadata extraction. Cannot write updated tags back to files after renaming. | mutagen for read+write. |
| psycopg2 | Sync driver. Blocks the event loop. Cannot be used with async SQLAlchemy. | asyncpg for async PostgreSQL access. |
## Version Compatibility
| Package A | Compatible With | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| SQLAlchemy >=2.0.48 | asyncpg >=0.30.0 | Use `postgresql+asyncpg://` connection string. Some older asyncpg versions (0.29.x) had issues with `create_async_engine`. |
| essentia-tensorflow >=2.1b6.dev1389 | Python 3.13 | Only available on Linux x86_64. Use platform marker `sys_platform != 'linux' or platform_machine == 'x86_64'` in dependencies. |
| FastAPI >=0.135.2 | Pydantic >=2.10 | FastAPI requires Pydantic v2. Do not install Pydantic v1. |
| FastAPI >=0.135.2 | Starlette >=0.46.0 | Pinned by FastAPI. Do not override. |
| Alembic >=1.18.4 | SQLAlchemy >=2.0 | Use `alembic init -t async` for async template. Import all models in `env.py` for autogenerate to work. |
| litellm | ALL | **Pin exact version.** Supply chain attack on 1.82.7/1.82.8 (March 2026). Use >=1.82.6,<1.82.7 or wait for verified post-incident release. Verify SHA checksums. |
| SAQ >=0.26.3 | Redis 7+ | Actively maintained. Drop-in replacement for arq with similar API. |
| pyacoustid >=1.3.0 | chromaprint (system) | Requires `fpcalc` binary on PATH. Install `chromaprint-tools` in Docker. |
## Confidence Assessment
| Area | Confidence | Reasoning |
|------|------------|-----------|
| Web framework (FastAPI) | HIGH | Verified current version, massive ecosystem, well-documented async patterns |
| Database (SQLAlchemy + asyncpg + Alembic) | HIGH | Standard production stack, verified versions, extensive async documentation |
| Audio metadata (mutagen) | HIGH | No real alternative for read+write. Stable, zero-dependency, widely used |
| Audio analysis (essentia-tensorflow) | HIGH | Comprehensive MIR library with pre-trained models for BPM, key, mood, style classification |
| Audio fingerprinting (pyacoustid) | MEDIUM | Library works but hasn't released since 2023. Stable API, low maintenance risk, but monitor |
| Task queue (SAQ) | HIGH | Actively maintained, async-native, Redis-based. Drop-in replacement for arq with built-in web monitoring UI. |
| LLM integration (litellm) | MEDIUM | Best abstraction layer but recent supply chain incident is concerning. Pin versions aggressively, verify checksums |
| Web UI (HTMX + Jinja2) | HIGH | Well-proven pattern for Python admin tools. No build step, no JS framework complexity |

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:
- `/gsd:quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd:debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd:execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
