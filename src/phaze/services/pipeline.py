    The DB cannot distinguish "nothing queued" from "everything queued" (``process_file``
    does not move a file out of ``DISCOVERED`` until a worker finishes it), so the only
    truthful in-flight signal is the live Redis queue depth read through SAQ.

    Sums ``count("queued") + count("active")`` across every non-revoked agent's per-agent
    queue (the same ``revoked_at IS NULL`` predicate ``dashboard()`` uses -- NOT
    ``select_active_agent``, which returns one agent and raises when none is recently seen)
    plus the controller queue. Only the ``queued`` and ``active`` kinds are read: those two
    kinds exclude scheduled/cron jobs, so the idle controller crons (``reap_stalled_scans``,
    ``refresh_tracklists``) never inflate the counts. The scheduled-inclusive kind is never
    read.

    Failure isolation is split per-source and the function never raises: a Redis hiccup or
    a missing ``app.state`` attribute (the test ``client`` skips the lifespan, so the queue
    handles are absent) must degrade that source to 0, never 500 the 5s dashboard poll. The
    agent and controller reads use independent ``try`` blocks so one dead source does not
    zero the other.

    ``controller_active``, ``agent_busy`` (= queued + active), ``controller_busy``.
